Abstract
Objective. Estimate trends in cardiovascular disease risk factors by body mass index (BMI) category among adults in England (n=115,860).
Methods. Risk factors included cigarette smoking; hypertension; total diabetes; and raised total cholesterol. Risk factor prevalence was computed in four 4-year time-periods: 2003-06; 2007-10; 2011-14; and 2015-18; change was computed as the difference between the first and last time-periods, expressed in percentage points (PP).
Results. Hypertension remained at a stable level among normal-weight men but decreased among men with obesity (-4.1 PP; 95% CI: -7.1, -1.0). Total diabetes remained at a stable level among normal-weight adults, but increased among adults with obesity (men: 3.5 PP; 1.2, 5.7; women: 3.6 PP; 1.8, 5.4). Raised total cholesterol decreased in all BMI groups, but fell more sharply among women with obesity (-21 PP; -25, -17) versus their normal-weight counterparts (-16 PP; -18, -14).
Conclusions. Greater reductions in hypertension and raised total cholesterol among adults with overweight and obesity partially reflect improvements in screening, treatment and control among those at highest cardiovascular risk. Higher levels of risk factor prevalence among adults with overweight and obesity, in parallel with rising diabetes, highlight the importance of national prevention efforts to combat the public-health impact of excess adiposity.
